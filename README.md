### GGUF_GUI: An easy way to convert your safetensors to GGUF

Easy installation:
```
bash run.sh
```
After the initial run you can just run:
```
streamlit run main.py
```

This should pull the repos and install the requirements.
You can do this with CUDA as well

To use the huggingface downloader you have to enter in the repo id:
for example: `username_or_org/repo_name` or `lysandre/test-model`.
